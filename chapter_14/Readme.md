1. I would type `rm blah.txt`
2. I would find the log file, then type `rm` plus the log filename

The command would look like this: `rm ~/tmp/development.log` (or wherever the file lives)

3. I would type `rm -rf /tmp/foo`

`rm -rf` is dangerous because it will remove everything from your root and all subfolders as well as their contents.
