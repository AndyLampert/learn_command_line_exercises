I am using jquery easing plugin, I want to apply the easing "easeInOutBounce" to a div rotation, but not like in this example (where, basing on 90, the rotation will be between 0 and 90):

num = 90;
$('div').animate({borderSpacing: num},{
    step: function(now){
        if(now >= num/2){xxx = num - now;}else{xxx = now;}
        console.log(xxx);
        $(this).css('transform','rotate('+ xxx +'deg)');
    },
    duration: 1000,
    easing: 'easeInOutBounce'
},'linear');
I want to do the rotation not starting by 0, but converting partial of the value in negative numbers, so the animation is balanced to 0:
in this case basing on 90, I want the animation between -45 and 45.

I made a bad calculation and I can't achieve the result I want... please help with a proper math calculation, any help is much appreciated!

Simply try now = now - num/2; instead of your if... statement.

This corresponds to the mapping now |--> now - 90/2 which has a range of [-45,45] when now has a domain of [0,90].
