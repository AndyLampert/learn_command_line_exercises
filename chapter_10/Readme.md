`ROBOCOPY` is an example Zed gives as a really stupid, unintuitive command.
 
 1. type `cp -r something new_folder`
 2. type `cp file_name.extention ~/Desktop`
 3. Open finder and open the file 
 4. type `cp -r something/ new_folder/` to make sure they are actually files
 
1. I would type `cp foo.txt ~/temp`
2. I would type `cp ~/.bash_profile .`
