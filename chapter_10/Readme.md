## Story Questions
**Can you copy the foo.txt file to slash temp?  (Create foo.txt first...)**
> I would type `touch foo.txt`, then `cp foo.txt ~/tmp`.
 
**Can you copy .bash_profile in your home directory to the current directory?**
> I would type `cp ~/.bash_profile .`.

## Do More
**Use the cp -r command to copy more directories with files in them.**
 > I typed `cp -r prac temp`. 
 > I also typed `cp -r prac/ temp/ another_practice_dir/`

**Copy a file to your home directory or desktop.**
> I typed `cp neat.txt ~/Desktop`, then `find ~/Desktop -name neat.txt` to make sure it was there!

**Find these files in your graphical user interface and open them in a text editor.**
> I opened Finder, clicked on www, then expanded the folder until I found the file, then double clicked on the file.

**Notice how sometimes I put a / (slash) at the end of a directory? That makes sure the file is really a directory, so if the directory doesn't exist I'll get an error.**
> I didn't know that!
